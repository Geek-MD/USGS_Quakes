# USGS Quakes

> **Note:** Only one instance is supported at a time.  
> Requires Home Assistant 2024.6.0 or newer.

**USGS Quakes** is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) that monitors earthquake events from the [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/). It provides `geo_location` entities for each event matching your filter criteria.

## Features

- Fetches earthquake data directly from USGS GeoJSON feeds.
- Creates `geo_location` entities for each event.
- Creates a `sensor.usgs_quakes_latest` datetime sensor showing the latest event time.
- Stores recent events as sensor attributes (filtered by configured magnitude).
- Filters by:
  - Location (latitude, longitude, radius)
  - Minimum magnitude
  - Feed type (e.g., past day, past week, significant earthquakes, etc.)
- Updates automatically every 5 minutes (or on demand).
- Entities include full metadata (magnitude, location, time, etc.).
- Supports configuration via Home Assistant UI.
- Supports configuration updates via the "Configure" button in the integration panel.
- **Manual update service:** Use `usgs_quakes.force_feed_update` to force a feed refresh at any time.

## Installation

### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)

> Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is already installed in your Home Assistant.

1. **Add as custom repository in HACS:**  
   Go to **HACS > Integrations > Custom repositories**, enter:

   ```
   https://github.com/Geek-MD/USGS_Quakes
   ```

   Select **Integration** as the category and click **Add**.

2. **Install USGS Quakes:**  
   Search for **USGS Quakes** in HACS integrations and install.

3. **Restart Home Assistant.**

---

### Option 2: Manual

1. Copy this repository into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory:

    ```bash
    cd /config/custom_components
    git clone https://github.com/Geek-MD/USGS_Quakes usgs_quakes
    ```

2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

Once installed, go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations**, click **Add Integration** and search for **USGS Quakes**.

**Note:** Only one instance is supported at a time.

## Configuration

All configuration is done via the UI.

### Fields

- **Latitude / Longitude**: Center point for filtering.
- **Radius (Km)**: Distance from the center point to search for events.
- **Minimum Magnitude (Mw)**: Events below this magnitude are ignored.
- **Feed Type**: Select the feed source. Friendly names are shown in the UI.

You can later modify the radius, magnitude and feed type from the integration options.

## Feed Types Supported

A total of 20 USGS feed types are supported, including:

- Past Hour / Day / Week / Month - All earthquakes
- Significant Earthquakes (summary)
- Filtered by magnitude (1.0+, 2.5+, 4.5+)

See [USGS GeoJSON Documentation](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) for details.

## Sensor: `sensor.usgs_quakes_latest`

This integration creates a datetime sensor reflecting the latest detected event.

- **State**: Date and time of the most recent event (in ISO format, UTC).
- **Attribute `events`**: List of up to 10 most recent events above the configured magnitude, each including:
  - `id`
  - `magnitude`
  - `place`
  - `time` (UTC)

This helps track and trigger automations based on recent seismic activity.

## Manual Update Service

The service `usgs_quakes.force_feed_update` can be triggered manually from **Developer Tools > Services** in Home Assistant, or from automations/scripts. This will immediately refresh the earthquake feed and update entities.

```yaml
service: usgs_quakes.force_feed_update
```

No parameters are required. The feed will be refreshed, and new events will be processed instantly.

## Known Issues

- Only one instance is supported at a time (currently).
- Feed entries older than the last scan might be skipped.
