# USGS Quakes

**USGS Quakes** is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) that monitors earthquake events from the [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/). It provides `geo_location` entities for each event matching your filter criteria.

---

## üåç Features

- Monitors earthquakes from the USGS GeoJSON feed.
- Filters by:
  - **Minimum Magnitude (Mw)**
  - **Maximum Distance** from your location (Radius)
- Creates `geo_location` entities for each event.
- Includes a special sensor `sensor.usgs_quakes_latest` that:
  - Stores only **new** earthquake events (based on their unique `id`)
  - Exposes a formatted list of recent events:
    - Title
    - Place
    - Magnitude
    - Date/time (local)
    - Google Maps link to epicenter

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.6.0 or newer
- Internet access to fetch data from USGS

---

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Go to **Integrations ‚Üí Custom Repositories**.
3. Add this repository:
   ```
   https://github.com/Geek-MD/USGS_Quakes
   ```
   Select type: **Integration**
4. Install and restart Home Assistant.
5. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration** and select **USGS Quakes**.

---

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download this repository.
2. Copy the folder `custom_components/usgs_quakes/` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration via the UI.

---

## üîß Configuration

All configuration is done through the UI.

### Options

- **Latitude / Longitude** ‚Äì Your location
- **Radius (Km)** ‚Äì Max distance to include earthquakes
- **Minimum Magnitude (Mw)** ‚Äì Ignore earthquakes below this
- **Feed Type** ‚Äì Select from 20 different USGS feeds (past hour, day, week, etc.)

You can modify these settings anytime from the integration‚Äôs **Options** menu.

---

## üì° Feed Types

Supported USGS feed types include:

- All earthquakes (past hour, day, week, month)
- Only significant events
- Filtered by magnitude: 1.0+, 2.5+, 4.5+

Full list: [USGS GeoJSON Feed Documentation](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

---

## üß™ Sensor: `sensor.usgs_quakes_latest`

This sensor exposes:

- `state`: Timestamp of the latest event
- `events`: List of the last 10 new earthquakes
- `formatted_events`: Multiline string with summary info

### Example:

```
M 5.2 - Near Valpara√≠so, Chile
Place: 8 km NW of Valpara√≠so
Magnitude: 5.2 Mw
Date/Time: 2025-09-18 04:33:22
Location: https://www.google.com/maps?q=-33.0458,-71.6197
```

---

## üöÄ Manual Feed Refresh

Call the following service to manually refresh the earthquake feed:

```yaml
service: usgs_quakes.force_feed_update
```

You can trigger this from Developer Tools, automations, or UI buttons.

---

## üí° Optional Lovelace Cards

For visualizing data in Lovelace, install the **USGS Quakes Cards** from the [companion repository](https://github.com/Geek-MD/usgs_quakes_cards):

- Map of recent earthquakes
- List of formatted events
- Button to manually refresh the feed

These cards are **not included in this repository** and must be added manually or via HACS (coming soon).

---

## üìì Notes

- On first setup, **all events** matching the filters are included.
- On updates, only **new events** (based on USGS `id`) are added.
- Sensor shows events in reverse chronological order (newest first).
- All magnitude and distance values follow standard units (Mw, km).
